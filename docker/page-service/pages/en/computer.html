<p>A <b>computer</b> is a device that can be instructed to carry out <a href="/wiki/Sequence" title="Sequence">sequences</a> of <a href="/wiki/Arithmetic" title="Arithmetic">arithmetic</a> or <a href="/wiki/Boolean_algebra" title="Boolean algebra">logical</a> operations automatically via <a href="/wiki/Computer_programming" title="Computer programming">computer programming</a>. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called <i><a href="/wiki/Computer_program" title="Computer program">programs</a>.</i> These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the <a href="/wiki/Computer_hardware" title="Computer hardware">hardware</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Operating_system" title="Operating system">operating system</a> (main <a href="/wiki/Software" title="Software">software</a>), and <a href="/wiki/Peripheral" title="Peripheral">peripheral</a> equipment required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a <b>computer system</b>. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a <a href="/wiki/Computer_network" title="Computer network">computer network</a> or <a href="/wiki/Computer_cluster" title="Computer cluster">computer cluster</a>.
</p><p>Computers are used as <a href="/wiki/Control_system" title="Control system">control systems</a> for a wide variety of <a href="/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller" title="Programmable logic controller">industrial</a> and <a href="/wiki/Consumer_electronics" title="Consumer electronics">consumer devices</a>. This includes simple special purpose devices like <a href="/wiki/Microwave_oven" title="Microwave oven">microwave ovens</a> and <a href="/wiki/Remote_control" title="Remote control">remote controls</a>, factory devices such as <a href="/wiki/Industrial_robot" title="Industrial robot">industrial robots</a> and <a href="/wiki/Computer-aided_design" title="Computer-aided design">computer-aided design</a>, and also general purpose devices like <a href="/wiki/Personal_computer" title="Personal computer">personal computers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mobile_device" title="Mobile device">mobile devices</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Smartphone" title="Smartphone">smartphones</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Internet" title="Internet">Internet</a> is run on computers and it connects hundreds of millions of other computers and their users.
</p><p>Early computers were only conceived as calculating devices. Since ancient times, simple manual devices like the <a href="/wiki/Abacus" title="Abacus">abacus</a> aided people in doing calculations. Early in the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for <a href="/wiki/Loom" title="Loom">looms</a>. More sophisticated electrical <a href="/wiki/Machine" title="Machine">machines</a> did specialized <a href="/wiki/Analogue_electronics" title="Analogue electronics">analog</a> calculations in the early 20th century. The first <a href="/wiki/Digital_data" title="Digital data">digital</a> electronic calculating machines were developed during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>. The speed, power, and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then.
